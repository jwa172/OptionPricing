# Project Overview

This project outlines the theory and implementation of pricing Arithmetic Asian call options using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) stock process.
The aim is to summarise the different Asian option pricing approaches from existing literature and also discuss some practical implementation details as well as their computational efficiency. 

<!-- ## Installation & Requirements
