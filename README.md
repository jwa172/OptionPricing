# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of pricing European call options using two distinct price dynamics: **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and **Variance Gamma (VG)** models. The focus is on computational methods rooted in Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques, guided by the influential paper *"Option Valuation Using the Fast Fourier Transform"* by Carr and Madan (1999).

## File Structure

- `option_nb.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all code implementations, explanations, and visualizations.

## Installation & Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `scipy`: For scientific and mathematical functions.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualisation.
