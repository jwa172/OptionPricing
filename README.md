# OptionPricing

This project walks through the implementation of pricing European call options using the GBM and VG price dynamics.

The pricing methods are centered around Fourier Transform and FFT techniques based on the paper 'Option Valuation using the Fast Fourier Transform', Carr and Madan (1999).

The implementation is completely contained in Jupyter notebook file 'option_nb.ipynb' and the following libraries are required to run the code:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
